    <h2>Two Friends. One Bad Hand. Infinite BBQ.</h2>
    <p>Not every restaurant is born from a business plan. <strong>Jack Deuce</strong> came from two immigrants, a deck of cards, and a burning desire to feed people — and win at poker. So far, only one of those is going well.</p>
    <p>They met years ago at a smoky underground game in a city that no longer exists on any official map. Both fresh off the plane, both bluffing with confidence they hadn’t earned yet. They played hard, bet harder, and bonded over a shared inability to ever fold — especially not <em>Jack Deuce</em>.</p>
    <p>Why that hand? No one knows. Not even them. But if superstition is a spice, they were already halfway to Korean BBQ.</p>
    <p>Over time, they swapped out card tables for prep tables and casinos for kitchens. Their dream? To bring <strong>authentic Korean BBQ</strong> to a place that didn’t know it needed it — <strong>Cherokee, North Carolina</strong>. Why Cherokee? Simple:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>There’s a <strong>great casino</strong></li>
      <li>A <strong>lack of grilled meat</strong></li>
      <li>And the <strong>mountains feel like home</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>So they set up shop across from <strong>Harrah’s</strong>, rolled up their sleeves, and got to work. No gimmicks. No shortcuts. Just <strong>charcoal, flavor, and fire</strong>. They named the place Jack Deuce — not because it made sense, but because it made <em>them</em>.</p>
    <p>Now, people come from all over to try their bulgogi, sip soju, and argue about whether <strong>Jack Deuce</strong> is a curse or a gift. (Hint: if you’re eating here, it’s a gift.)</p>
    <p>This is <strong>Jack Deuce Korean BBQ</strong>. <br><strong>All in on flavor. Never folding. Always betting big.</strong></p>
